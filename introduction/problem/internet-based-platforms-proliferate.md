# Internet-Based Platforms Proliferate

Internet-based platform businesses have been proliferating since the dot.com boom in the 2000s. With the increasing availability of big data, deep learning, machine learning, sensors and sensor data, as well as distributed ledger technology solutions, such technology-driven evolution of internet-based platform businesses can be expected to expand exponentially.  


Since their inception, internet-based platform businesses have been disrupting centralized brick and mortar businesses. At least some evidence is provided by the disappearance of over half of the S&P 500 companies in the last 15 years. Competition from internet-based platform businesses is among the core factors that contributed to this trend.  


Perhaps the dominant example that helps illustrate the prevalence of internet-based platform businesses is the comparison of a traditional brick-and-mortar business, such as Marriott, with a core internet-based platform business competitor, such as Airbnb. As of September 2016, Marriott is 90 years old with 1.1 million rooms listed in 110 countries, it has 127,500 employees and a valuation of $17.8 bn, e.g. value per employee $0.1m. By contrast, Airbnb is 9 years old as of September 2016, has 2 million listings in more than 191 countries, 4227 employees, a valuation of $30bn, and a valuation per employee of $7m. On all metrics of comparison, the internet-based platform business is dominating the brick-and-mortar business. While this is of course only one example of many others, it illustrates the core strengths of platform businesses and shows a trend in business development.  


Internet-based platform services are so successful because their peer-to-peer capabilities make them compelling, efficient, and attractive in a fast-changing world. That is why people are so willing to place their trust in new businesses and brands.  


But before they were widely adopted, trust issues that obviously exist in a peer-to-peer environment had to be solved. Why would consumers trust somebody you donâ€™t know or who is anonymous? Search algorithms, data analytics, and consensus protocols have helped digitize trust by minimizing bad experiences, maximizing great experiences, and avoiding unwanted issues \(such as the double spending of cryptocurrencies\). Yet, consumers continue to struggle with trust issues with these platforms. Digital trust may sound more attractive than institutionalized trust, but it still has its shortcomings. The most serious challenge for them are the trust crises on the internet.
