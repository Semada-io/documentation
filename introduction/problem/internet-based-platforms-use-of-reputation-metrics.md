# Internet-Based Platforms Use of Reputation Metrics

Internet-based platforms use reputation metrics in an effort to improve their customer experience and their own business models.  Those include Facebook’s “like” mechanism as well as reputation rankings on Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb.

Several studies have demonstrated that existing reputation solutions for internet-based platform businesses are subjected to significant shortcomings. Resnick and Zeckhauser find that:  “One of the earliest and best known internet reputation systems is run by eBay, which gathers comments from buyers and sellers about each other after each transaction. Examination of a large data set from 1999 reveals several interesting features of this system, which facilitates many millions of sales each month. First, despite incentives to free ride, feedback was provided more than half the time. Second, well beyond reasonable expectation, it was almost always positive. Third, reputation profiles were predictive of future performance. However, the net feedback scores that eBay displays encourages Pollyanna assessments of reputations, and is far from the best predictor available. Fourth, although sellers with better reputations were more likely to sell their items, they enjoyed no boost in price, at least for the two sets of items that we examined. Fifth, there was a high correlation.”

**The shortcomings of this use of reputation in internet-based platform businesses include the following:**  


* All centralized reputation scores can be sybil attacked, e.g. fake internet accounts \(sockpuppets\) or fictitious ratings disrupt true reputation scoring
* Users earned their reputation but do NOT own reputation - e.g. if Facebook and other internet-based platform businesses accidentally deleted user account, years of data would be removed and users have near zero ability to reclaim the data
* All financial and reputation scores are trapped in Silos. Such reputation data incompatibility undermines interoperability between platforms. There is also no way to aggregate user reputation in disparate platforms.
* Users cannot build reputation-based social capital - the platforms control the reputation and users cannot otherwise engage with the reputation built on such platforms.
* No Privacy: Employers have unfettered access and are checking people on social media and credit checks. No way to curtail for users
* No Reputation Data Autonomy for users
* No Reputation-Based Network Effect - lacking decentralized aggregation of reputation. Reputation currency created on the Platforms only benefits the respective platforms
* No Self-Sovereign Identity
