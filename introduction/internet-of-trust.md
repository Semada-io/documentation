# Internet of Trust

While trust in old world organizations and procedures has been eroding for years, society is not convinced that distributed or decentralized peer-to-peer networks can deliver enhanced digitized trust. To truly enable a more distributed society, it is necessary to personalize and humanize digital trust.

Semada and the Semada Research Institute \(SRI\) believe that a decentralized reputation infrastructure can increase and humanize trust on the internet and in decentralized technology solutions. We call this solution the Semada Internet of Trust.

Core building blocks of the Semada Internet of Trust are Semadaâ€™s protocols that enable a trust verification network.
