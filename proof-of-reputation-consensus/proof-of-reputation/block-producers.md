# Block Producers

Blocks are produced by PoR experts, i.e., users who hold sem tokens in the PoR expertise tag in Semada. Someone who produces a block is called a ​producer​.

To become an PoR expert, a user gains PoR sem tokens by sending any fee to the system. As detailed in the [Semada Core](https://semada.gitbook.io/project/~/edit/drafts/-LOR-BrqGcbLwNLx1I2a/semada-core), this starts a validation pool in which the user is vested with sem tokens proportional to the fee they sent if the bench experts vote in favor of the application. In the beginning of the PoR expertise tag, the protocol will allow anyone to win their validation pool, without review.

As proven in [Calculations](https://semada.gitbook.io/project/~/edit/drafts/-LOR-BrqGcbLwNLx1I2a/proof-of-reputation-consensus/proof-of-reputation/calculations), validating all applications without review is quite secure against currently foreseeable attacks, even without the extra natural protection the validation pool could afford. However, protocols for acceptance will certainly evolve in the forum, possibly including such precautions as giving upper and lower bounds for fees, and potentially requiring some form of outside reputation proportional to the fee to be tied to the account which can be slashed in case of proof of malfeasance.
