# Benefits

Semada’s solutions for consensus protocols fall into 5 general categories: decentralization, efficiency, autonomy, anonymity, and most importantly, security.

**1. Decentralization.** PoR inhibits the centralization problem which arises in all previous blockchains, whether they use bitcoin’s PoW or a flavor of PoS such as BitShare’s DPoS or Ethereum’s Casper. In each of these cases, mining pools or block production cartels arise because lotteries, or voting delegations, or economy of scale give outsized rewards to powerful groups.

Under most any PoS system, the economy of scale advantage is mitigated because doubling your computing power does not double your power to build blocks.

PoR solves the other decentralization threats, since there is only ever the incentive to be part of one block production cartel, the Semada platform itself, because all fees are distributed fairly in a salary according to each user’s sem holdings.

Further decentralization is achieved under PoR because it is easy for anyone to become a block producer and validator. This naturally encourages the widest possible distribution of stakeholding. So PoR doesn’t suffer from the tragedy of the commons problems other mining protocols engender for 3 reasons. 1\) Stakeholders are empowered to participate, since every one of them gains more sem tokens by running the validation programs most recently upvoted in the forum to police block creation. 2\) Stakeholders are motivated to improve the collective value of sem so that their salary is increased, which only happens when more fees are attracted, which happens when the platform is improved. 3\) Rent-seeking stakeholders who do not participate in the validation process will generally suffer from the inflationary nature of the token.

Finally the nature of the platform is decentralized in the sense that if all but one of the nodes goes offline unexpectedly, the blockchain will continue and can regenerate from the one node38. This is because the protocol chooses future producers from the existing availability smart contracts; and when a producer doesn’t submit a block, future producers are still chosen.

**2. Autonomy.** The Semada platform on a PoR blockchain achieves perfect autonomy. The bench, the forum and the validation pool run off the Semada smart contract which runs entirely on the gas of whatever blockchain it is posted to.

Consensus is established in the forum, which is simply a collection of linked posts to the blockchain. Consensus on every suggested protocol upgrade, including program upgrades to the Semada DApp itself, is determined entirely by the bench, after debate in the forum, when validation pools conclude. There is no need for any outside centralized foundation to organize protocol forks, such as deciding how and when to scale or shard to handle more transactions, or what the standards are for block creation and policing. All protocol upgrades are therefore handled swiftly, decisively, and openly, with minimal disruption, through the weighted democracy of sem-staked decision making.

The incentive for developers to propose improved protocols on chain comes from the potential for reward given by the reference system in the forum WDAG. This allows future posts to reference development posts which initially attracted no fees, in order to share their fees as a matter of protocol.

This also solves the debate over how to slash. There are, of course, infinitely many possible protocols for determining when and how an expert producer should be punished for producing a corrupt block, whether fighting against double spending/forking, or censorship, or other attacks. Whatever protocol is adopted will witness hacking/gaming attempts. The forum and validation pool will provide the evolutionary ecosystem for continually improving slashing protocols.

**3. Efficiency.** Compared with PoW implementations, such as bitcoin and Ethereum, PoR is far more computationally efficient. Nodes will no longer hash mine. They will check the validity of the blocks, but they do that under any blockchain. The only added computation is the validation pool which happens once for each block, where nodes send one transaction, an up- or downvote.

**4. Anonymity.** Reputation is determined by actions validated on the platform, independent of any other establishment of identity. The most common actions are faithfully running

the programs established in the forum to validate and produce blocks according to protocol.

**5. Security.** Probity is assured via the positive feedback loop with properly aligned incentives.

1. **Fees** from public users are shared with all experts through the reputation-weighted salary, so expert users are motivated to produce maximally useful blocks and to police other experts’ block production, in order for the system to attract more fees from public users.
2. **Finality** for a block \(the state where a block is confidently considered to be a permanent part of the chain\) is measurable under PoR.

   First, a measurable number of expert validators risked their sem tokens on the bet that the block was valid.

   Secondly, the sem that members gain from policing block production is equal to half of all fees sent since the production of the block. In order to fork a chain from that particular block, the community will lose all sem tokens created subsequently on the chain to be forked.

   Further, since the value of the sem tokens is in the promise of future fees, all token holders are motivated to maintain the long-term stability of the chain, and less motivated by arbitrage opportunities from malicious forks or censorship.

3. **Slashing** is a natural part of PoR through the loss of availability stakes, a strong disincentive for any violation of the hard protocols validated in the forum. This solves the nothing-at-stake problem \(or tragedy of the commons problem\) associated with previous chain-based PoS protocols.

   The possibility of review through references in the forum to change the value of sem tokens allows slashing to address more subtle, long-term patterns of “spirit of the law” soft protocol violations.

4. **Liveness faults**. When users don’t participate in block creation or validation they are naturally punished by a devaluation of their sem token holdings from the natural inflation of the token which occurs during token creation. This punishment is ​**stable** in the sense that it does not dramatically and unfairly punish honest users who lose connectivity, so honest users do not lose security for their investment as nodes.
5. **Blacklists​.** Besides the slashing of availability stakes, producers and validators who demonstrate subtle, long-term patterns of protocol violation, such as censorship of transactions, may be added to blacklists developed in the forum. Then any new block produced by a token holder from the blacklist would be invalidated by majority vote. The openness of the blockchain allows analysis of past blocks in order to write these blacklists, and the validation pool ensures accuracy and fairness in their creation. Blacklisted users will not lose their tokens, which adds stability to the system, giving token holders confidence the system is not arbitrary and fickle. Blacklisted users will have the ability to argue their case in the forum using their tokens while they remain. While they are blacklisted, however, they will not be able to gain sem by producing any further successful blocks. Due to the natural inflation of the sem tokens, the blacklisted producers stakes will inevitably diminish in value as further blocks are produced.

   f. 51% attacks are inhibited in a measurable manner through the mechanisms, and because the feedback loop is closed and complete. 

   In the various 51% attacks a group that owns a significant percentage of the governing tokens can profit at the expense of the platform and the other users by exerting their power. The 51% attack is particularly dangerous in decentralized systems with potentially anonymous users because there is usually no recourse to dispute resolution. Therefore if there is the opportunity to maliciously profit, someone in the world will certainly take advantage.

   One type of 51% attack is the arbitrage scenario where a group will buy up 51% of the tokens, make a short term profit at the expense of other users \(double spending, editing, or censoring, e.g.\) then quickly sell off the tokens before their value declines from the damage done.

   Almost all other blockchain platforms sell off a significant number of their tokens in an initial token sale, or mine them, or a combination of both. Either way, these tokens are almost always perfectly fungible currencies.

   Semada’s tokens are different than most every other platform’s tokens. They can theoretically be bought and sold by buying the anonymous user’s account. So sem tokens are valuable, but not perfectly fungible for 3 reasons.

   i. Sem tokens do not hold their value as well as other currencies, naturally experiencing significant deflation. This is because more sem tokens are added to the system every time a fee is sent to the platform, so their relative value in earning the reputation-weighted salary constantly diminishes. \(See Appendix A.2.\) Therefore, if they are not being used
