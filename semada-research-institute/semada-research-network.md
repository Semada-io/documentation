# Semada Research Network

The Semada Research Network \(SRN\), a decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\) on the Semada Platform that originates and implements research proposals for the Semada Platform.

SRN is the research engine within the Semada platform. Its purpose is the identification of valuable new research ideas and protocol upgrades. SRN is a DAO on the Semada Platform and an expertise tag within Semada core.

Members of the SRN DAO develop and implement the research agenda for SRI by:

1\)   posting architecture expansion agendas or individual proposals, including via new use cases of Semada Core, and providing evidence of their research for protocol expansion, and

2\)   writing and posting code in Github or Bitbucket that is directly enhancing or further expanding the Semada Core architecture and/or its associated protocols, including its use cases and agenda.  


SRN DAO Candidates:

Membership of the SRN DAO is contingent on being selected by the existing SRN DAO members. Candidates for SRN DAO membership only qualify if they posted valuable protocol upgrades that were upvoted by the existing members.

SRN DAO members get paid for their upvoted protocol contributions in both SEM Tokens and SRN Tokens. SEM tokens are fungible and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. SRN Tokens are not fungible. SRN Tokens are the membership tokens that grant access to the SRN DAO. Only the SRN Tokens are used for voting on incoming protocol improvement proposals.
