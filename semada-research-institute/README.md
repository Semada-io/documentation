# Semada Research Institute

The Semada Research Institute \(SRI\) is a blockchain research laboratory that develops and promotes research built on the core reputation verification algorithm of the Semada Platform. Combining existing Semada protocols, such as Persona and Sockpuppet Protocols, among others, SRIâ€™s initiatives and research agenda is directed by the resolutions passed by the Semada Research Network \(SRN\). Together, SRI and SRN develop a research agenda to implement the Semada core as a truly decentralized reputation-based trust engine for the Internet of Trust in the distributed economy.
