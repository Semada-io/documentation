# Reputation as True Decentralization

The transferability of stores of value entailed in cryptocurrencies creates core points of attack and undermines the very nature of decentralization. Because of the store of value entailed in cryptocurrencies \(and really any currencies or store of value\), exercise of power over such value inevitably leads to centralization due to economies of scale.

Reputation as a metric and store of value does not suffer the same consequences described above and does not lead to centralization because it must be earned, it can be lost, yet it cannot be turned into a fungible store of value that allows the exchange for goods etc.  Hence, reputation does not naturally lead to centralization like currencies do.
