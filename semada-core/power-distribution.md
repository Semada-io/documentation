# Power Distribution

The Semada platform encourages efficient collaboration through accurate distribution of power according to reputation. The only rewards possible are received for expert-evaluated improvements to the platform. The system is designed to resist economic corruption and inefficiencies by fairly evaluating all work through the measured vesting of valuable reputation.

The forum is the environment where experts demonstrate their value. Experts gain reputation by posting and evaluating posts. Successful posts are comments in the forum which win the upvote validation pool. Winning the validation pool means the other experts evaluate the post and believe it improves the value of the expertise. Types of posts include:

* policies for future development of the expertise
* protocols for acceptable behaviour
* evidence of experience
* evidence of work
* creating or improving smart contracting templates
* criticizing any of the above

  
 Upvotes naturally determine the strength of precedence set by each comment.
