# System Autonomy

The platform achieves full autonomy almost immediately. Once the Ethereum DApp is posted to the blockchain, its authors have no more control over the evolution of the expertise tags in its forum than any other Ethereum user. Creation, hosting, and maintenance costs are borne entirely by users through fees paid to the platform, which are distributed to the expert users after paying Ethereum gas fees.
