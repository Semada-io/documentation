# Semada Core

Semada is an autonomous decentralized platform for validating domain specific reputation. The main design goals of the Semada platform are to:

1. evaluate domain specific reputation across a wide variety of expertises
2. insure security, including resistance to Sybil attacks, tyranny of the majority, and 51%

   attacks

3. provide a minimal, robust core architecture which supports modular constructions for a

   wide range of use cases.

The key features are

1. a ​positive feedback loop which promotes productive cooperation between public and expert users
2. maximal freedom for experts in the creation of reputation verification protocols
3. complete autonomy—the economic structure is closed to off-domain influence; all power

   and fees are shared entirely by expert users, weighted by reputation

4. meritocracy—the platform supports anonymity, rewarding ability and productive

   contributions over personal identity.

The Semada platform creates a transparent, fair, and predictable system that facilitates certainty of outcomes, security, and efficiency. Society benefits from the advancement of justice and prevention of corruption on a global scale.
