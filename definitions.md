# Definitions

In the following, the Semada Research Institute is naming and defining certain core functions of the Seamada Platform: 

## \*\*\*\*

## **Anchor DAO \(ADAO\)**

Core function: Block propagation. The Anchor Protocol DAO is the Semada DAO responsible for block production. Each time a block is produced, the SEM Token denominated fees from the transactions in the block are shared with the entire Anchor DAO members as SEM Token denominated reputation salary \(SEM Token is earned for each block in proportion to DAO membersâ€™ Anchor token holdings\). As Anchor DAO members participate in the block validation pools and join winning pools their Anchor token increases. Conversely, if they more often lose in validation pools, their Anchor holdings decrease. Several subsidiary DAOs will be created based on technological protocol network needs to the Anchor DAO. Payment of ADAO members: SEM Fee Sharing in proportion to ADAO token ownership

## Network Improvement DAO \(NIDAO\)

The NIDAO is tasked with network innovation for SRI. Membership of the SRN DAO is contingent on being selected by the existing NIDAO members. Candidates for NIDAO membership only qualify if they posted valuable protocol upgrades and business proposals that were upvoted by the existing members. NIDAO members get paid for their upvoted protocol contributions in both SEM Tokens and NIDAO Tokens. SEM tokens are fungible and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. NIDAO Tokens are not fungible. NIDAO Tokens are the membership tokens that grant access to the NIDAO. Only the NIDAO Tokens are used for voting on incoming protocol improvement proposals.  


## Stability DAO \(SDAO\)

The SDAO is the central policy making DAO for the Semada Stability Mechanism.  It creates a core improvement over existing stability mechanism for cryptocurrencies. SDAOs is needed for multiple oracle functions in the stability mechanism and enables an unprecedented fully decentralized stability model. External datapoint on stability success of  SEM
