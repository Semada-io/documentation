# Anchor DAO

The Anchor Protocol DAO is the Semada DAO responsible for block production. Each time a block is produced, the SEM Token denominated fees from the transactions in the block are shared with the entire Anchor DAO members as SEM Token denominated reputation salary \(SEM Token is earned for each block in proportion to DAO membersâ€™ Anchor token holdings\). As Anchor DAO members participate in the block validation pools and join winning pools their Anchor token increases. Conversely, if they more often lose in validation pools, their Anchor holdings decrease.  


Several subsidiary DAOs will be created based on technological protocol network needs to the Anchor DAO.
