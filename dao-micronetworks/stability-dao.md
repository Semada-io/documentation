# Stability DAO

Semadaâ€™s Stability DAO \(SDAO\) creates a core improvement over existing stability mechanism for cryptocurrencies. SDAO is needed for multiple oracle functions in the stability mechanism and enables an unprecedented fully decentralized stability model. Some of its core improvements include:

* Fully decentralized policy decision making
* Full transparency of policy decision making
* Determination of the SEM / US Dollar exchange rate
* SEM monetary and fiscal policy decisions
* Select a Consumer Price Index \(CPI\) for the peg \(removing the US Dollar peg\) \(CPI has some correlation with the value of the US Dollar - DYP\)
* SDAO determines artificial bond token price floor to ensure SDAO does not borrow excessively in attempt to limit SEM supply
