# Network Innovation DAO

The Semada Network Innovation DAO \(NIDAO\) is tasked with network innovation for SRI .

Membership of the SRN DAO is contingent on being selected by the existing NIDAO members. Candidates for NIDAO membership only qualify if they posted valuable protocol upgrades and business proposals that were upvoted by the existing members.

NIDAO members get paid for their upvoted protocol contributions in both SEM Tokens and NIDAO Tokens. SEM tokens are fungible and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. NIDAO Tokens are not fungible. NIDAO Tokens are the membership tokens that grant access to the NIDAO. Only the NIDAO Tokens are used for voting on incoming protocol improvement proposals.
