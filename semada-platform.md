# Semada Platform

Semada is a 4th generation blockchain platform for the decentralized web.  The core components of the platform are: a\) core protocol stack to achieve consensus, repel network attacks and propagate transaction blocks, b\) immutable decentralized memory ledger to store transaction blocks, c\) network resource market/exchange to stake CPU, memory, bandwidth, etc. for rent seeking, d\) programmable smart contract interface for transaction and resource manipulation.  

The architecture is intended to solve the blockchain trilemma, combining scalability, security, and decentralization.  The underlying protocols create inherent trust on the network based on a decentralized reputation system of trust scores. Semada is modular, has an advanced smart contracting platform and on-chain governance for swift protocol upgrades. Semada is resilient to Sybil attacks, tyranny of majority and 51% attacks. Through its universal trust protocol, Semada removes corruptible intermediaries and creates trusted paths to form an unprecedented trusted mesh as the foundation for the web 4.0.

Through cryptoeconomic incentives Semada adds network resources to process and propagate.

Semada is a decentralized platform that methodically builds trust for smart contracting parties and the smart contracting code itself. Semada properly rewards good-faith business behavior and smart contract development, providing an ideal evolutionary environment where business can continually improve and grow.

This evolutionary business environment is achieved by employing the basic strengths of blockchain technology: decentralization, an eternal record, and transparency. This allows Semada to create meaningful and secure SEM tokens which represent the reputation of members, with different types of tokens for every different type of expertise.

These foundational objects of secure and meaningful SEM tokens solve many basic problems in blockchain technology, such as giving the proper incentives for guaranteeing secure proof-of-stake consensus protocols for block production. This eliminates the unsustainable inefficiencies of proof-of-work based blockchains. Meaningful reputation tokens also naturally incentivize stable and productive on-chain governance for all protocol upgrades. With on-chain governance true DAOs are achieved for any type of business.

This general environment for creating DAOs provides the level playing field many independent companies require to negotiate and collaborate in developing the IoT. SEM tokens provide the membership identification layer for the IoT, where any device with the proper reputation can be trusted to add or download information, and use smart contracts to automatically settle remuneration debts. The proper reputation is provided to a device if it is verified as being installed following the protocols specified by the particular DAO for the specific device.
