# Trust Crises on the Internet

Human lives are defined by who, what, when and how humans trust. While we tend to think of “trust” and “trusting” as a feeling or emotion, a better way to think of trust may be the particular types of decisions humans make. In essence, humans “trust” when we decide to take some kind of risk. This trust can involve banal decisions such as what local supermarket to choose or which physician to select for a particular treatment. Trusting also involves a decision to expose ourselves to a danger of some kind. We decide to place our fate in another person or organization. As such, trust can be seen as the triumph of hope over fear. We overcome our natural aversion to risk in anticipation of a better future \(a tasty meal, good health etc.\). Every day, all of us make many different decisions to trust. Together, these choices define who we are and what matters to us.  But who, what, when and how we trust is changing.  


The public trust in institutions and institutional governance, e.g. institutionalized trust, has been eroding for years. Scandals, corruption, slow procedures, human error, inefficient legacy systems, etc. increasingly destroy trust in the organizations and procedures of the modern world. As a result, we live in an age of diminishing trust in organizations and procedures. We are less and less willing to place our fate in the hands of incumbents and traditional ways of doing things.  


To restore confidence in the “old world”, efforts have tended to focus on introducing and implementing more regulations, processes, and procedures. Yet, the traditional trust and cohesion mechanisms have reached their limits. Who and how we trust has already changed. The world of organizations \(corporations, government, etc.\), and procedures is being replaced by new forms of trust. Slow and expensive experiences have resulted in greater distrust in established institutions and their products and services.  
This has driven the emergence of new and disruptive internet-based platform business models. Trust has become digitized and automated. We are much less trusting of organizations or procedures, but instead trust machines and algorithms. Yet, this digitized trust is experiencing its own crises which undermines the proliferation of value-enhancing internet-based platform businesses and DLT businesses.  


The trust crises on the internet cannot be directly traced and have several origins and may in fact have a generational dimension. Because of the dominance of a few select broadband internet service providers, changes in the net neutrality rule, and concerted efforts at misinformation of the public via internet campaigns, the internet has become a network of vertically and horizontally integrated monopolies that create core deficiencies including: a\) constrained knowledge exchange because of information silos, b\) lack of competition impedes innovation \(including at the protocole level\), c\) increased exposure to cyber and socially engineered attacks, d\) diminished consumer protection and rights. These deficiencies in today’s internet age consistently and progressively undermine trust on the web.  


Human interaction with machines on the internet exacerbates the internet trust crises. Humans trust machines on the internet to store and process information and to transact with each other and with machines. Yet no centralized or decentralized authentication engine has typically verified the trust humans place in machines or otherwise enabled a trusting environment for internet-based transactions. Worse yet, today’s internet is designed for hierarchical societal structures and with an underlying authoritative trust model. Many inefficiencies are associated with the traditional hierarchical trust model including serious cyber security vulnerabilities.

Several studies have provided evidence on the acceleration of trust issues on the internet around the globe. Trust issues in the United States can clearly be distinguished as exacerbated in international comparison.Cyber security attacks may be among the factors that help explain the decline in trust on the internet. Anecdotal evidence suggest that the cost of instigating cyber attacks have declined significantly. Cyber security attack can now be launched by unsophisticated parties at minimal cost with maximal potential for damage.

By the year 2020 the majority of experts estimates that a total of 30 to 50 billion devices will connect to the internet. The prevailing opinion of these researchers suggests that the centralized version of the internet cannot scale to that level. This creates unprecedented cyber security issues. Decentralized authentication solutions for IoT devices are needed.

The Edelman report also suggests that trust is on the decline worldwide among multiple metrics. Fake news are contributing to this world wide trend.

2. Throughout human history, personal trust is first established within closed families and communities. Yet, in an industrialized and globalized world, trust is established by organizations \(governments, businesses, schools, and other intermediaries\) and procedures \(rules, contracts, and hierarchies\). Modern economy and society are built on the success of these more impersonal or institutionalized forms of trust.
