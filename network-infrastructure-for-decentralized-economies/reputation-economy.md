# Reputation Economy



SRI recognizes the shortcomings in internet-based platforms’ attempts to use reputation. Based on that recognition, SRI has developed the core Semada Architecture as a new platform that enables a decentralized reputation economy.  


Current internet-based platforms use reputation to improve their centralized control structures. By contrast, SRI’s core protocols facilitate the infrastructure for a decentralized reputation economy.

SRI’s decentralized reputation solutions have several advantages over existing internet-based platforms’ attempts at utilizing reputation to improve their business models:

* Interoperable contextual reputation scores remove reputation data silos
* Reputation scores and reputation personas, e.g. profiles, cannot be created by fake internet accounts. The  Semada Sockpuppet Protocol enables that through its sybil attack resistance
* Users build and actually own and control their respective reputations through the respective Semada DAOs in a fully decentralized way. The system is designed to avoid and disable any form of centralized corporate control over reputation
* Decentralized reputation scores allow users to build reputation-based social capital. Since the users own their own scores, they can now use their reputation scores to gain traction in various business contexts
* Complete privacy through anonymity of scores
* Users gain full reputation data autonomy

These core benefits of Semada’s decentralized reputation solutions can create unprecedented business models and new forms of economic output that facilitate a decentralized reputation economy:

* **Network Effects**: are created by removing data silos via interoperable contextual reputation scores, combined with users’ social capital, new network data, and users’ self-sovereign identity
* **New Network Data**: The reputation solutions create an unprecedented kind of data SRI calls Rich Context Reputation GRAPHS which create new networks based on different kinds of reputation data
* **Social Capital**: Users’ control over their reputation creates social capital that can be applied and utilized in unprecedented settings, facilitating new business lines and options for capital formation
* **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Semada Persona Protocol Human Uniqueness Identifiers enable users to control their own digital identity to identify or de-identify from the network
