# How To Read This Documentation

This documentation provides a guide to the core infrastructure of the Semada Network and its solutions. 

Readers can review the high level topics to gain a general understanding of the Semada Network and its features or click down further into subtopics until they find the mathematical formulas that create the intellectual framework for the Semada Network. 

Please note that this documentation is continuously updated. As new findings materialize and after they are reviewed and assessed by the SRI and Semada Labs teams, they will be uploaded. Please also note that new solutions and new research may sometimes necessitate revisions or deletions of earlier research published herein. We are making every effort to publish all underlying mathematical equations. Yet, certain mathematical content may only be published in this documentation after peer review.
