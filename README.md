# How To Read This Documentation

This documentation provides a guide to the core infrastructure of the Semada Network and the solutions is provides. 

The documentation is structured in layers that enable readers to first gain a general understanding of the Semada Network and its features before accessing the mathematical foundations and incentive designs.  Readers can start by reviewing the high level topics or click down further into subtopics that explain the intellectual foundations of Semada. 

Please note that this documentation is continuously updated. New  research will be uploaded once the SRI and Semada Labs teams have released it. Please also note that new solutions and new research may sometimes necessitate revisions or deletions of earlier research published herein. We are making every effort to publish all underlying mathematical equations. Yet, certain mathematical content may only be published in this documentation after peer review.
